User Profile Page - Component Design


Description of Module
The User Profile page enables the user to manage their card sets and group memberships. There is a hyperlink to the User Preferences page. The module consists of one page that displays the titles of the user’s card sets and the names of the user’s groups. Clicking on a group title leads to the Group Library page. There is a “Leave Group” button by each group title. Clicking on a card settitle leads to the view page for the card set. There is a hyperlink button next to each card set title, labeled “Edit”, that leads to the Edit page for that set. Next to each card set title is a button labeled “Delete”, which deletes the card set. Finally, there is a button labeled “Create New Set”, which leads to the Edit page for a new card set.


urls.py
Maps the URLs to the view functions.


“.../list/user/[user]/”                                        → list(request, setID), 
“.../list/user/[user]/log_out”                                →log_out(request)
“.../list/user/[user]/set/delete_set/[set]/”                → delete_set(request, set)
“.../list//user[user]/group/leave_group/[group]/”        → leave_group(request, userID, groupName)
“.../list/user/[user]/set/new_set/[set]”                        → to_set(request)


Template
The module contains one template, which displays the list of card sets and the list of groups. It displays two tables, one populated with the user’s card sets, and one with the group of which the user is a member.


Views
The module uses six view functions.

context = user.getSets(userID) gets the list of sets,
context = user.getGroups(userID) gets the list of groups.


log_out(request)
Purpose: Logs the user out, deletes the cookie storing the user’s login information. Called by clicking the “Log Out” button.
Library functions: HttpResponseRedirect() reloads the page.
