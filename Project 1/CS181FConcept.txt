Concept: A Program for Digitized Flashcards


In a nutshell, our concept emulates the traditional flashcard as closely as possible in a digital format. The core of the project could be designed around a web page where users access, create, share, and store their flashcards. Possible additions include mobile device applications as well as desktop applications. These two extensions would provide similar functionality as the website but would allow users to use their stored flashcards without having Internet access.  Digital flashcards would be advantageous to physical flashcards because they can be more easily stored, organized, and copied. They can also be shared between groups of friends or among a class. These flashcards could be stored locally within an application, or remotely on a cloud server. In addition, making digital flashcards would allow us to implement tactics used to maximize studying efficiency, such as spaced repetition and the Leitner system, which can be used to greatly increase the effectiveness of studying.  Designing a working system for this concept should not be difficult because all members of the group have used flashcards and understand the basic ideas behind them. Working on this project would be enjoyable because as a group, we are interested to learn about creating and running web based applications. We are also interested to learn about interacting with and managing a cloud based system.
