userTable:
*question: why is userID necessary? I thought we were planning on using email to uniquely identify the user?


UserSetTable:
*either setID or setName should be a unique identifier.  No need for duplication.


cardTable:
*userID should be a PositiveInteger() so that it also specifies order... in the complete project a unique card would be identified by set, cardID, and authorID, but since we are not doing the full project we only need set and cardID
*set should not be a ManyToManyField because each card only belongs to one set.
