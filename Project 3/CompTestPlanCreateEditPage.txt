Component Test Plan: Create/Edit Set Page


Testing Summary
        Tests for this model are divided into black box tests and white box tests, and both will be performed with the django.test module.  In the black box testing, the general specification requirements are verified.  The white box testing will test the five view functions as well as performing additional tests to ensure full code coverage.


Testing Framework
To test this module, we will primarily use the django.test module which is based off of a standard python test module, unittest.  This will enable us to automate our black box and white box tests.  The django.test module works by communicating directly with the django framework and avoiding the overhead of having to communicate with the server (although tests integrating a server can also be performed).  HttpRequest get and post methods are simulated with the django.test get([url]) and post([url], [data]) functions.  These get() and post() functions return django response objects.  In order to verify that tests have full code coverage, django provides a simple way of integrating the coverge.py module.  Tests of this module will be run in the tests.py file.


Test Index
1. Black Box Testing:
        1.1 Add flashcards to set
        1.2 Delete flashcards from set
        1.3 Modify existing flashcard within set
        1.4 Rename and reorder flashcards within set
        1.5 Modify an existing set contained within the user library
        1.6 Add content to newly created sets
1.7 Submit incorrect flashcard creation data (non-integer or non-unique flashcard order)
1.8 Submit incorrect flashcard modification data (non-integer or non-unique order)
2. White Box Testing:
        2.1 list()
        2.2 create_fc()
        2.3 show_fc()
        2.4 update_fc()
        2.5 delete_fc()


Test Descriptions
1. Black Box Testing: In general, the black box testing will be performed by calling a series of post() and get() functions.  The final return response object will then be examined closely to make sure it matches what is expected.  A true value will be returned for a successful matching.  To make these calls, the urls must be entered in as arguments into the functions as well as any HttpRequest POST data.  While this does require basic knowledge of the url mapping scheme, the intent is to automate as closely as possible the actions of an actual user.
1.1 Add flashcards to a set: This test verifies that a flashcard can be successfully added to the set.  This test will be performed by first creating a new flashcard, and then navigating back to the list page, and then opening it again and checking that the contents match what is expected.
1.2 Delete flashcards from a set: This test verifies that when a flashcard is opened and deleted (and navigation is restored to the list() page), the flashcard will have disappeared from the list.
1.3 Modify existing flashcards within a set: This test verifies that a flashcard’s front and back sides can be successfully modified.  It performs in an analogous manner to 1.1.
1.4 Rename and reorder flashcards within a set: This test verifies that a flashcard’s title and order can be changed.  Once again, this is verified in a process similar to 1.1.
1.5 Modify an existing set contained within the user library: The purpose of this test is to test part of the interface between the user profile page and the create/edit page.  To perform this test, a set will be opened, modified, and then opened again, and the modified contents will be checked to make sure they match what is expected.
1.6 Add content to newly created sets: The test also tests the interface between the user profile page and the create/edit set page.  It is performed like the test above except we are creating a new set instead of modifying an existing set.
1.7 Submit incorrect flashcard creation data (non-integer or non-unique flashcard order): This test works to see that incorrect user data causes and error to be displayed.
1.8 Submit incorrect flashcard modification data (non-integer or non-unique order): This test also checks to see that an error is displayed.


2. White Box Testing: Like black box testing, the white box testing will work by calling a series of post() and get() functions.  One of the primary purposes of the white box testing will be to test any code not tested in the black box testing.  Once the black box tests are complete, and the coverage.py module is run, any untested code in any of the five views will be tested by additional white box tests.
