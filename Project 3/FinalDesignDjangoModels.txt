Component Design: Django Models


For my component, I will be designing three separate models, which are Django’s way of representing tables in the database. Since these models will be relied on by all of the webpage/view components, it was decided best for them all to be designed by a single person.

# model: userTable

# Description
# This model is responsible for storing the information about every user in the system.

#     - email address
#     - password
#     - which user groups they are a members of
#     - which flashcard sets (stored in another table) each user owns


class userTable(models.Model):
   # userID:   A unique identifier number for each user
   userID
