User Profile Page - Component Design


Description of Module
The User Profile page enables the user to manage their card sets and group memberships. There is a hyperlink to the User Preferences page. The module consists of one page that displays the titles of the user’s card sets and the names of the user’s groups. Clicking on a group title leads to the Group Library page. There is a “Leave Group” button by each group title. Clicking on a card set title leads to the view page for the card set. There is a hyperlink button next to each card set title, labeled “Modify”, that leads to the Create/Modify page for that set. Next to each card set title is a button labeled “Delete”, which deletes the card set. Finally, there is a button labeled “Create New Set”, which leads to the Create/Modify page for a new card set.


urls.py

“.../list/[user]/set/[set]/”                → delete_set(request, set)
“.../list/[user]/group/[group]/”                → leave_group(request, userID, groupName)
