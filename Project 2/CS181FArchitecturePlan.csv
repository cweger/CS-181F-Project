Fail to create a viable architecture","Medium risk. We will work to make sure that our architecture is described completely, and that our description makes sense to readers unfamiliar with the project.

Low risk. If our architecture is poorly made, the design review process should help us to fix any issues with it."

Design review fails to notice flaws in our architecture","Medium risk. If any issues cause problems, we will meet with the group that reviewed our design to ask questions, or we will meet with Prof. Kampe.
